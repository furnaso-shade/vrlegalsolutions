Any unused portion of the retainer may be refunded to the client upon the completion of the matter.<br>6. Confidentiality<br>The Firm will maintain the confidentiality of all information provided by the client, in accordance with legal and ethical obligations.

Should a conflict arise, the Firm will inform the client and take appropriate action, which may include withdrawing from the case if necessary.<br>8. Termination of Services<br>Either the client or the Firm may terminate the engagement at any time by providing written notice.
