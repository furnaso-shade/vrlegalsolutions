These terms and conditions govern your use of the services provided by VR Legal solutions ("the Firm"). By engaging our services, you agree to be bound by these terms. Please read them carefully before proceeding.
2. Scope of Services
The Firm offers legal advice and representation across various areas of law. The specific scope of services will be outlined in a separate engagement letter or contract provided upon retaining the Firm. The terms of the engagement letter shall take precedence over these general terms in case of any conflict.
3. Client Responsibility
Clients are required to provide accurate and complete information relevant to their case or legal matter. The Firm is not responsible for any outcome affected by incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the client.
4. Fees and Billing
The Firm charges fees based on an hourly rate, flat fee, or contingency fee arrangement, as specified in the engagement letter. Clients are responsible for paying all fees, disbursements, and out-of-pocket expenses (including court fees, filing fees, and other related expenses) unless otherwise agreed in writing.
Interest may be charged on overdue accounts at a rate of 18% per month.
5. Retainers
A retainer fee may be required before commencing any work on a client's case. The amount of the retainer and the terms under which it is held will be outlined in the engagement letter. Any unused portion of the retainer may be refunded to the client upon the completion of the matter.
6. Confidentiality
The Firm will maintain the confidentiality of all information provided by the client, in accordance with legal and ethical obligations. However, the Firm may disclose information to third parties where necessary to perform services on behalf of the client (e.g., expert witnesses or opposing counsel) and as required by law.
7. Conflicts of Interest
The Firm will take steps to identify and avoid conflicts of interest. Should a conflict arise, the Firm will inform the client and take appropriate action, which may include withdrawing from the case if necessary.
8. Termination of Services
Either the client or the Firm may terminate the engagement at any time by providing written notice. Upon termination, the client is responsible for paying any outstanding fees and expenses up to the date of termination. The Firm reserves the right to retain all files and documents until full payment has been made.
9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Firm's liability for any claim, loss, or damage arising out of the provision of services shall be limited to the fees paid by the client for the services in question. The Firm is not liable for any indirect, consequential, or punitive damages.
10. No Guarantee of Outcome
The Firm does not guarantee any specific outcome or result in any legal matter. All legal matters carry inherent risks, and the Firm will provide legal advice based on its professional judgment but cannot ensure success in any case.
11. Use of Website and Online Communication
If the Firm maintains a website, any content provided there is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Use of the website or communication through online forms does not establish an attorney-client relationship unless expressly stated.
12. Data Protection and Privacy
The Firm complies with applicable data protection and privacy laws. Personal data collected from clients will be used only for the purposes of providing legal services and as outlined in the Firm’s Privacy Policy.
13. Governing Law
These terms and conditions and any services provided by the Firm shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Jurisdiction.
14. Amendments
The Firm reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions at any time. Any changes will be communicated to the client, and continued use of the Firm’s services constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
15. Entire Agreement
These terms, along with the engagement letter, represent the entire agreement between the Firm and the client and supersede any prior communications or understandings.
